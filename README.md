## Objectives

Farefinder addresses the problem of overpriced Uber fares during high-demand periods by suggesting nearby, lower-cost pickup alternatives. While designed to help users avoid surge pricing near large events, it is equally useful for finding affordable rides at any time.

> _"Why walk into surge pricing when cheaper options are just around the corner?"_

The application utilizes a geospatial search algorithm to suggest nearby cheaper locations within a configurable walking distance. Though integration with the official Uber API is still in progress, a mocked API is currently used for development and testing.
